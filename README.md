### Welcome to the Brain Games!

Use the *make build* command to build the package and make sure you set it up correctly. \
To install a package from the operating system, use the _make package-install_ command. It must be run from the root directory of the project.

You have five games to choose from:
* brain_even - a game in which you have to determine whether a number is even
* brain_calc - a game where you have to figure out what is the result of an expression?
* brain_gcd - a game to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
* brain_progression - a game in which you have to determine the missing number according to the arithmetic progression
* brain_prime - a game in which you have to determine whether a number is prime or not 

To win each game you must give **three correct answers in a row** !
To start the game, type '_make ..._', replacing ... with the name of the game 
Good luck ;)
